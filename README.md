# 🧠 AI Digital Twin for Human Risk Prediction

## 🚀 Overview

AI Digital Twin is a preventive AI system that creates a virtual representation of an individual to predict future risks across multiple domains:

- ❤️ Health Risk
- 💰 Financial Risk
- ⚠ Scam Vulnerability

Unlike traditional systems that react after problems occur, this platform provides early warnings using Machine Learning and Explainable AI.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Individuals cannot effectively assess their future health, financial, and scam-related risks.  
Most current systems are reactive — they respond only after damage has already occurred.

There is no unified, personalized AI platform that predicts multi-domain risks proactively.
